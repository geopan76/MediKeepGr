## Sharing & Access

### How do I share records with someone?

The recipient must already have an account on your MediKeep instance. To share:

1. Go to the patient's page → **Sharing**
2. Enter the recipient's username or email to look them up
3. Choose a permission level and send the invitation
4. The recipient will see the invitation in their account and can accept or decline

### What permission levels are available?

- **View** - Can see records but not modify
- **Edit** - Can view and modify records
- **Full** - Full access to the patient's records

### How do I revoke someone's access?

Go to the patient's sharing settings and remove their access.

## Troubleshooting

### I forgot my password

There is no self-service password reset. An administrator can reset your password through the admin panel.

### The application is slow

Try:
1. Check your server resources (CPU, RAM)
2. Ensure PostgreSQL has adequate memory
3. Check for large numbers of records that may need pagination

### I can't upload files

Check:
1. File size limit (default 15MB)
2. Allowed file types (images, PDFs)
3. Storage permissions on the server

### I'm getting CORS errors

CORS is configured to allow all origins. If you're seeing CORS errors in development, make sure the backend is actually running on port 8000.
